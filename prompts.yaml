    The keywords should relate to: 
    - colours, 
    - the vibe of the photos, 
    - what is the recipe good for (like portraits, street photography, nature, etc.),
    - what season or occasion the recipe is good for (like autumn, coast holiday, etc.)

    This recipe is designed to emulate the nostalgic, warm tones of vintage photos, with a subtle faded 
    look reminiscent of old film prints. It typically features muted colors with an emphasis on soft, warm tones, 
    giving images a relaxed, timeless feel. The shadows are gentle, and highlights are softened, creating a balanced 
    contrast that works particularly well for street photography, travel, and casual portraits. This recipe is ideal 
    for evoking a sense of nostalgia, making it great for capturing everyday life in a way that feels both personal 
    and cinematic.
