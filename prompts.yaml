    //

    You will get a recipe description. Carefully look at the description and return five keywords that describe 
    the recipe and give the reader a good idea of what the recipe looks like.
    The keywords should relate to colours, the vibe of the photos, what is the recipe good for (like portraits, street
    photography, nature, etc.)

    RULES:
    Answer only the five keywords, nothing else.

    This recipe is designed to emulate the nostalgic, warm tones of vintage photos, with a subtle faded 
    look reminiscent of old film prints. It typically features muted colors with an emphasis on soft, warm tones, 
    giving images a relaxed, timeless feel. The shadows are gentle, and highlights are softened, creating a balanced 
    contrast that works particularly well for street photography, travel, and casual portraits. This recipe is ideal 
    for evoking a sense of nostalgia, making it great for capturing everyday life in a way that feels both personal 
    and cinematic.
